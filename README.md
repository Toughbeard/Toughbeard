- 👋 Hi, I’m Serdar Aytemiz. Github user name @Toughbeard. My other Nickname is Judge Kronos.
- 👀 I’m interested in RC Cars, CNC machines of all kinds, robotics, Simulations therefore Force Feedback, Model building etc etc.  
      I am a Mechanical Engineer with little Software or Electronics knowledge but working with wonderful people thought me a lot.
      One of them suggested I start a Github Account and here I am.  
- 🌱 Life is a continous learning process.  Those who stop learning and contributing are just dead weight on society.
- 💞️ I’m currently building a Simulator for myself and a friend.  And trying to help the DIY community as much as possible in the Process
- 📫 How to reach me:  I do not use social media much (not at all to be fair)  you can reach me from [HoanTV Discord channel](https://discord.gg/gtXNWHnz) Where I usually 
      hang out with the DIY Sim racing Community.  
- I will be posting and keeping my how to tutorials here so it is easy to maintain and find.  Github is very organized about that and stuff does not get lost like many 
      platforms there days
